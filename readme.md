# Gmail Reader

Uses Google OAuth API to access your own gmail account.

Current example ETL:

- Login to email using OAuth
- Query for email from `no-reply@outpostclimbing.rezeve.com`
- Compiles all the emails into a single `dataframe`
- Data will show details of each time I went to the `outpost gym`
